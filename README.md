# Full-Stack CRUD Application with NestJS, ReactJS, and MongoDB

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the following technologies:

- **NestJS**: Backend framework to handle server-side logic.
- **ReactJS**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store application data.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and run MongoDB locally.
- **Context API**: To manage the state in React.
- **Chakra UI**: To provide a set of accessible and customizable UI components.
- **React Icons**: To include icons in the application.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- Seamless integration between backend and frontend.
- Containerized environment for easy setup and deployment.

## Technologies and Their Roles

### Backend

- **NestJS**
  - _Role_: Manages server-side logic, routes, and controllers to process requests and interact with the MongoDB database.

### Frontend

- **ReactJS**

  - _Role_: Manages the client-side logic and rendering of the application, interacting with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.

- **Context API**

  - _Role_: Manages application-wide state, making it easier to handle and share data across different components.

- **Chakra UI**

  - _Role_: Provides ready-to-use UI components for a consistent and customizable design.

- **React Icons**
  - _Role_: Adds icons to the application for better visual representation and user experience.

### Database

- **MongoDB**
  - _Role_: Stores and manages the data used in the application, supporting CRUD operations performed by the backend.

### Containerization

- **Docker**
  - _Role_: Containerizes the MongoDB database, providing an isolated environment for running the database locally.
